### Hey! I'm Camille! 

I go by she/her pronouns

I can't believe how much I've learned about software engineering since starting work in October of 2021! I wish I could refactor a lot of the code in this repository (I did most of this as an undergrad), but maybe I'll leave these old projects as-is to reflect on how far I've come. 

### I'm a...

- 👩‍💻 MLOps/DevOps Engineer and Data Scientist at Ford Motor Company (2021-present)
- 📜 2021 Master in Applied Mathematics, earned at the University of Washington
- 🎓 2020 Seattle University grad (B.S. Mathematics, B.A. Physics, Chinese minor, _summa cum laude_)

### My goals for the next year include...

- ☁️ Learning Google Cloud Platform for machine learning operations
- 🖥 Learning data structures and algorithms
- 🌍 Visiting two countries outside of the USA

When I'm not on the computer, I enjoy surfing, piano, bouldering, and hiking.
